# Maze-solver
Maze solving addition to the maze generator code (does not function correctly).
Disclaimer - The code does not show a valid way of solving a maze. After trying to implement the dijkstra algorithm into python code I seemed to have come up against an obstacle which I could not overcome unfortunately. This is my attempt at creating the maze solver.
# This program will attempt to solve a maze by using the Dijkstra algorithm.

How to start up
* To run the application, you will need an interpreter. I reccomend using VScode as that is the program I used when coding and testing the application.

* Ensure pip is installed, you should already have it installed if you have an up to date version of python.

* You will also need the turtle library installed.

* In the console, type in "pip install turtle".

* Once turtle is installed you will be able run the program which you can do in VScode by pressing F5.

* You will see a maze being generated using turtle and then dots being placed in each cell of the maze.

* Once the program is finished you will be left with a maze with a bunch of dots in each cell. This is because I couldn't quite get the program to function correctly it seemed to be solving a different maze potentially but after playing around with it for a while I couldn't find a solution to the problem.
